# B* or B+ Tree

This program provides a search execution benchmark of B* Tree.

The search benchmark consists of two parts:
<ul>
<li>
  The first one gets the number of comparisons, number of transfers from disk and execution time from the preprocessing           part, that's the period which the program is building the tree.
</li>

<li>
  The second one is based on the same criterias, but get them from the searching period in the tree.
</li>
</ul>

At the end of the execution a message is printed showing if the key was found or not and a message containing all the benchmark data.

## How to execute?

To compile:

`make`

Compiling the program generates a binary file called b+tree.
To run there's some allowed options:

<ol>
  <li> If you want to generate an instance file, you can use the -g, -n, -o and -P tags.
  <ul>
    <li> -g number - where number is the quantity of registers. The -g tag is not optional if you want to create an instance.       </li>
    <li> -n name - where "name" is the name of your file instance. This argument is optional and the standart is "arquivo.bin"       </li>
    <li> -o order - where "order" is the order that you want to create your file. Is an optional tag and the standart is crescent. You can use "c" for crescent, "d" for decrescent and "a" for random.
    </li>
    <li> -P - this tag is used if you want to show the generated values.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li> To starts a search:
    <ul>
    <li> -p number - where number is the key you want to search </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Only emphasizing that you can run all this commands in the same execution. </li>
</ol>
